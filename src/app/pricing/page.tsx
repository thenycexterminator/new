    q: "What does $249/hour actually include?",
    a: "Everything needed to solve your pest problem. Labor, EPA-registered products, treatment methods (chemical, gel bait, traps, heat, exclusion materials), entry-point sealing, written treatment plan, and the free re-treatment visit if pests come back inside the guarantee window. There are no per-room fees, no chemical surcharges, no trip fees, no inspection fees, no contract minimums, no weekend rates, no holiday rates. The hour is the hour.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why hourly instead of a flat-rate quote like every other NYC exterminator?",
    a: "Flat-rate quotes are priced for the worst-case version of your problem the company has never inspected. If your actual job is simpler, you still pay the inflated number — the company keeps the difference. Hourly bills you for the time your specific problem actually takes. A small ant trail might be 30 minutes ($125 all-in). A serious roach infestation might be 90 minutes ($375). You pay for time, not for the company's guess at a worst case. We built this site as the only fully inclusive hourly exterminator pricing platform in NYC because the flat-rate model is built to overcharge most customers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I pay anything upfront?",
    a: "No. Nothing upfront. No deposit. No card-on-file required to schedule. The free inspection is free. The hourly clock doesn't start until you approve the treatment plan. The invoice goes out after the work is done. If you're not satisfied, you don't pay.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any contracts?",
    a: "No. Zero. No monthly minimums. No auto-renewals. No 'maintenance plan' lock-in. You book one visit. We solve the problem. You pay for that hour (or fraction of an hour) and we're done. If you want a follow-up later, you book another single visit at the same $249/hour rate. That's it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the catch?",
    a: "There isn't one. We were tired of NYC pest control being a 'call for a quote' black box where the price is whatever the company thinks you'll pay. $249/hour, billed in 15-minute increments after the first hour, fully inclusive, pay on completion. That's the entire pricing model. No hidden fees, no chemical surcharges, no upsells, no bait-and-switch.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the hour timed? When does the clock start?",
    a: "The clock starts when treatment begins, after the free inspection is complete and you've approved the plan. It stops when the technician finishes the work. Travel time, the inspection itself, and writing the treatment plan are not billed. The first hour is the minimum; after that we bill in 15-minute increments ($62.25 per quarter hour), rounded honestly to actual time worked.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is hourly really cheaper than a flat-rate quote?",
    a: "For most NYC jobs, yes — meaningfully cheaper. A typical one-bedroom roach treatment takes 45-60 minutes ($187-$249 with us, all-in). The same job flat-rate elsewhere quotes at $300-$500, then often adds chemical and trip fees. Mouse exclusion on a small apartment runs 60-90 minutes ($249-$374). Flat-rate elsewhere: $400-$700+ before add-ons. Bigger jobs — multi-room bed bug heat treatment, large commercial accounts — can run longer with hourly, but you still pay only for actual time. Either way, you know the model is honest because the rate is the rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about emergencies, weekends, holidays?",
    a: "Same $249/hour rate. No surcharges. We don't think 'your roach problem at 9pm on Saturday' should cost double what it costs Monday at 2pm.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the guarantee?",
    a: "If the pests come back inside the guarantee window for the service you booked, we return at no charge. No 'gotcha' clauses. No requirement to sign a maintenance plan to qualify. The free re-treatment is included in the original $249/hour rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if the job takes less than an hour?",
    a: "The first hour is the minimum — $249 — same as any tradesperson with truck-roll and setup costs. After that hour, you only pay for the time actually used, in 15-minute increments.",
  },
  {
    q: "Multi-unit buildings, commercial accounts, restaurants — same rate?",
    a: "Same $249/hour rate, same fully inclusive model, same pay-on-completion. Larger jobs simply take more hours. For ongoing commercial accounts where DOH-compliant documentation and scheduled visits are needed, the visits are still billed hourly with no contract — you choose when to book the next one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Payment methods?",
    a: "Credit card, debit card, ACH, Zelle, or check. Payment is due on completion. We don't require deposits. For commercial accounts with recurring visits, net-30 invoicing is available.",
  },

            Why Hourly Is{" "}

          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-zinc-400">
            Every flat-rate quote in NYC is priced for a worst-case scenario you may not have.
            Hourly is the only pricing model where the customer&apos;s incentive and the
            company&apos;s incentive line up.
          </p>

              <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-zinc-300">
                Flat-rate &ldquo;cockroach treatment: $400&rdquo; means the customer with the easy
                30-minute job subsidizes the customer with the brutal 90-minute job. Hourly bills
                everyone for their own time. Honest, simple, fair.

              <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-zinc-300">
                Flat-rate companies make more profit on fast jobs &mdash; so the incentive is to
                quote high, finish fast, leave. Hourly companies make the same per hour either way.
                The incentive is to actually solve your problem and stop returning.

                Flat-rate quotes hide profit in add-ons &mdash; chemical fees, sealing fees, per-room
                fees, trip fees. We don&apos;t need add-ons because we&apos;re billing by the hour.
                Everything is included in the rate. No surprises on the invoice.

                Calling for a flat quote means a stranger guesses your job over the phone, prices for
                the worst case to protect themselves, then locks you in. Hourly means we inspect for
                free, you approve the plan, and you only pay for actual time spent.
