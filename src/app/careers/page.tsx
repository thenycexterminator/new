              The pest control industry in New York City is one of the most
              stable, in-demand, and recession-resistant trades in the country.
              With millions of residents, hundreds of thousands of commercial
              properties, a vast restaurant and hospitality sector, and the
              unique pest pressures that come with the densest urban environment
              in America, NYC will always need skilled exterminators and pest
              control professionals. Rats, mice, cockroaches, bed bugs,
              termites, ants, spiders, and urban wildlife are permanent fixtures
              of the New York City landscape, and the demand for professional
              extermination services only continues to grow year over year.
            </p>
            <p>
              At {SITE_NAME}, we are at the center of that demand. Our{" "}

              span the full spectrum of residential and commercial
              extermination, from single-unit cockroach treatments and studio
              apartment bed bug heat remediation to building-wide pest
              management programs, restaurant rodent control contracts, and
              commercial warehouse integrated pest management plans. Our
              exterminators work in every type of property across every borough
              and surrounding region &mdash; which means our team members gain
              more diverse, hands-on pest control experience than they would at
              almost any other extermination company in the metro area.

            <p>
              The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects continued growth for pest
              control workers nationwide, and the NYC metro area consistently
              ranks among the top markets for exterminator employment and pest
              control career opportunities. Starting salaries for licensed pest
              control technicians in New York City exceed national averages by
              a significant margin, and experienced exterminators with
              specialized certifications and leadership experience can earn
              substantially more. When you factor in the comprehensive benefits,
              paid training, company vehicle, and advancement opportunities we
              offer, a career at {SITE_NAME} is one of the best decisions you
              can make in the pest control profession.
