              To work as a pest control technician or exterminator in{" "}
              {neighborhood.name} with {SITE_NAME}, you will need a NYS DEC
              Commercial Pesticide Applicator license (Category 7A for general
              pest control, with 7F and Category 8 preferred for fumigation and
              public health work). If you do not yet have your license, we offer
              full licensing support including study materials, practice exams,
              tutoring, and payment of all exam and application fees. Many of
              our best exterminators obtained their certification through our

            <p>
              For wildlife control specialist positions serving{" "}

              though familiarity with the extermination industry is a strong
              plus. All new hires at {SITE_NAME} go through our comprehensive
              paid training program regardless of prior experience, covering
              company procedures, pest control protocols, safety standards,
              customer service expectations, and the specific pest challenges
              of each neighborhood in our service territory including{" "}

              Beyond formal certifications, successful exterminators in{" "}

              customer-focused, and committed to doing the job right the first
              time. Bilingual skills (English/Spanish) are highly valued given
              the diverse communities we serve in {neighborhood.region}. A valid
