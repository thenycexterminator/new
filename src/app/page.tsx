    {
      q: "How much does pest control cost in NYC?",
      a: "Pest control costs in NYC vary depending on the pest type, severity of infestation, and property size. General pest control treatments typically start at $125–$300 for a single visit. Bed bug heat treatment costs $1,000–$1,500 per room. Rodent control and exclusion work ranges from $200–$600. Termite treatment costs $500–$2,500 depending on the scope. We always provide a free inspection and upfront pricing before any work begins — no hidden fees, no surprises.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer same-day pest control and exterminator service?",
      a: "Yes. We offer same-day and emergency pest control service for urgent situations throughout NYC, NJ, Long Island, and Westchester. Whether it's a wasp nest near your front door, a rat sighting in your restaurant kitchen, or a bed bug discovery the night before guests arrive, our licensed exterminators can respond quickly. Call or text us and we'll dispatch a technician as soon as possible.",
    },
    {
      q: "Are your pest control treatments safe for pets and children?",
      a: "Absolutely. All of our pest control treatments use EPA-approved products with targeted application methods designed to minimize exposure to people and pets. Gel baits are placed inside cracks, crevices, and wall voids — areas away from everyday contact. Our exterminators always provide specific safety instructions tailored to your household before and after every treatment.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you service apartments, houses, and commercial properties?",
      a: "We provide pest control and exterminator services for every property type — studio apartments, co-ops, condos, townhouses, brownstones, single-family homes, restaurants, offices, retail stores, warehouses, and multi-unit residential buildings. Our licensed exterminators serve all five NYC boroughs, New Jersey, Long Island, and Westchester County.",
    },
    {
      q: "Are your exterminators licensed and insured?",
      a: "Every single one of our pest control technicians holds a NYS DEC Commercial Pesticide Applicator license and is fully insured. Our wildlife control operators carry additional NYS DEC Nuisance Wildlife Control licenses. We maintain full general liability coverage on every job we perform, and we're happy to provide proof of insurance upon request.",
    },
    {
      q: "What areas does The NYC Exterminator serve?",
      a: `We provide pest control and exterminator services across ${totalNeighborhoods}+ neighborhoods spanning Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, New Jersey, Long Island, and Westchester. If you're anywhere in the NYC metro area, we've got you covered. Check our service areas page for your specific neighborhood.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How quickly can an exterminator get to my property?",
      a: "For standard appointments, we typically schedule within 24–48 hours. For emergency pest control situations — active wasp nests, large rodent infestations, or bed bug discoveries — we offer same-day service and can often have a licensed exterminator at your door within a few hours. Response times depend on your location and current scheduling, but we always prioritize urgent situations.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer pest control maintenance plans?",
      a: "Yes. We offer monthly, bi-monthly, and quarterly pest control maintenance plans for both residential and commercial properties. Regular maintenance is the most cost-effective way to prevent infestations before they start. Plans include scheduled inspections, preventive treatments, and unlimited callbacks between visits if any pests return. Commercial plans can be customized for NYC DOH compliance.",
    },
    {
      q: "What should I do to prepare for a pest control treatment?",
      a: "Preparation varies by treatment type. For general pest control, we ask that you clear areas under sinks, clean kitchen surfaces, and remove pet food and water dishes. For bed bug treatment, you'll need to launder bedding on high heat and declutter around bed frames. For rodent control, securing food sources is essential. Our team provides detailed preparation instructions specific to your treatment when you book.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you guarantee your pest control work?",
      a: "Yes. We stand behind every pest control treatment we perform. If pests return between scheduled treatments or within our guarantee period, we come back and re-treat at no additional charge. Our guarantee periods vary by service — general pest control carries a 30-day guarantee, while specialized treatments like bed bug heat treatment include a 90-day guarantee. We'll explain your specific guarantee before any work begins.",

                The NYC Exterminator is a full-service pest control company serving the entire New York City metropolitan area. From our headquarters at {ADDRESS.street} in Midtown Manhattan, our team of licensed exterminators provides comprehensive pest control services to residential and commercial properties across all five NYC boroughs, northern New Jersey, Long Island, and Westchester County. We specialize in eliminating every pest that thrives in the urban environment — from <Link href="/cockroach-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">cockroaches</Link> and <Link href="/bed-bug-treatment" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">bed bugs</Link> to <Link href="/rat-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">rats</Link>, <Link href="/mouse-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">mice</Link>, <Link href="/termite-treatment" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">termites</Link>, and <Link href="/general-pest-control" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">general household pests</Link>.

              <p>
                What sets our pest control company apart is our commitment to thorough, lasting results. Every job begins with a comprehensive inspection conducted by a NYS DEC-licensed exterminator who identifies not just the pest, but the source of the infestation and the conditions allowing it to persist. We then develop a customized treatment plan using EPA-approved products and industry-leading techniques — from targeted gel bait applications for <Link href="/cockroach-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">cockroach control</Link> to whole-room heat treatment for <Link href="/bed-bug-treatment" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">bed bug elimination</Link> to exclusion work for <Link href="/rodent-proofing" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">rodent-proofing</Link>.

              <p>
                We understand that pest problems in NYC are uniquely challenging. Dense multi-unit housing means infestations can spread rapidly between apartments. The city&apos;s massive food service industry creates constant pest pressure on restaurants and commercial kitchens. Old building infrastructure provides endless entry points for rodents and insects. That&apos;s why our pest control approach addresses the root cause — not just the symptoms — with treatments designed for the realities of New York City living. Whether you need <Link href="/emergency-pest-control" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">emergency pest control</Link> for an active infestation or a <Link href="/commercial-pest-control" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">commercial pest control maintenance plan</Link> to keep your business compliant, The NYC Exterminator delivers results you can count on.

              <p>
                New York City has one of the most challenging pest environments in the United States. The combination of dense population, aging building infrastructure, an enormous food service industry, and a temperate coastal climate creates ideal conditions for virtually every urban pest species. According to the NYC Department of Health, approximately 15% of NYC households report seeing cockroaches in their homes, and rodent complaints have increased significantly in recent years across all five boroughs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">Cockroaches</strong> are the most common pest in NYC apartments. German cockroaches — the smaller, light-brown species — infest kitchens and bathrooms, spreading through shared walls and plumbing in multi-unit buildings. A single female German cockroach can produce 30,000 offspring in a year. American cockroaches, the larger reddish-brown &quot;water bugs,&quot; invade basements, laundry rooms, and utility areas. Professional <Link href="/cockroach-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">cockroach extermination</Link> using gel baits, IGR treatments, and crack-and-crevice applications is the only reliable way to eliminate established cockroach populations in NYC buildings.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">Bed bugs</strong> remain one of NYC&apos;s most persistent pest problems. These blood-feeding insects spread through luggage, used furniture, and shared laundry facilities. NYC&apos;s Bed Bug Disclosure Act (Local Law 69) requires landlords to disclose bed bug infestation history to prospective tenants. Professional <Link href="/bed-bug-treatment" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">bed bug treatment</Link> — particularly whole-room heat treatment that raises temperatures above 120°F — is the most effective elimination method. Chemical treatments using residual insecticides can supplement heat treatment for severe infestations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="space-y-5 text-zinc-300 leading-7">
              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">Rats and mice</strong> are an iconic — and serious — NYC pest problem. The city&apos;s rat population is estimated in the millions, with Norway rats dominating at street level and in subway systems. Mayor Adams&apos; &quot;rat czar&quot; initiative and the expansion of containerized trash collection reflect how seriously the city takes rodent control. For individual properties, professional <Link href="/rat-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">rat extermination</Link> and <Link href="/mouse-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">mouse control</Link> combines strategic baiting, snap trapping, and — most importantly — <Link href="/rodent-proofing" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">rodent exclusion work</Link> to seal entry points and prevent re-infestation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">Termites</strong> cause more property damage in the NYC metro area than most people realize. Subterranean termites are the primary species, entering buildings through soil contact with foundations and causing structural damage that can cost thousands to repair. <Link href="/termite-treatment" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">Professional termite treatment</Link> uses liquid barrier treatments and bait station systems to protect properties. Annual termite inspections are recommended for all wood-frame structures, particularly in the outer boroughs, Long Island, Westchester, and New Jersey where soil conditions favor termite activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">Wildlife</strong> in NYC is more diverse than many residents expect. <Link href="/raccoon-removal" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">Raccoons</Link> nest in attics and crawl spaces. <Link href="/squirrel-removal" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">Squirrels</Link> chew through soffits and fascia to access warm interior spaces. <Link href="/pigeon-control" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">Pigeons</Link> cause extensive property damage with their acidic droppings and nesting materials. <Link href="/bat-removal" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">Bats</Link> — while ecologically beneficial — carry rabies risk and require licensed wildlife control for safe removal. All wildlife control in New York state requires a NYS DEC Nuisance Wildlife Control license, which all our wildlife specialists hold.

              <p>
                Your first pest control visit typically takes 45–90 minutes depending on the property size and pest type. The exterminator will inspect all areas of concern — kitchens, bathrooms, basements, attics, crawl spaces, exterior perimeters, and any areas where you&apos;ve noticed pest activity. For <Link href="/bed-bug-treatment" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">bed bug inspections</Link>, we may use K-9 detection teams for faster, more accurate results.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the inspection, your exterminator will show you exactly what they found — including the pest species, evidence of activity, entry points, and conditions contributing to the problem. You&apos;ll receive a written treatment plan and cost estimate before any work begins. For many common pest control services like <Link href="/cockroach-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">cockroach treatment</Link>, <Link href="/ant-extermination" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">ant control</Link>, and <Link href="/spider-control" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">spider treatment</Link>, we can often perform the initial treatment during the same visit.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Residential vs. Commercial Pest Control</h3>
              <p>
                While the core principles of pest control are the same, <Link href="/commercial-pest-control" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">commercial pest control</Link> requires specialized knowledge of NYC Department of Health regulations, food safety standards, and business continuity planning. Our <Link href="/restaurant-pest-control" className="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300">restaurant pest control program</Link> is designed specifically for NYC food service businesses, providing DOH-compliant treatments with full documentation for health inspections.
              </p>
              <p>
                For residential properties, we tailor our approach to the specific building type. Pre-war walk-ups, modern high-rises, brownstones, townhouses, and single-family homes each present different pest control challenges. Multi-unit buildings often require coordinated treatment across multiple apartments to prevent pests from simply migrating between units. We work with property managers, co-op boards, and landlords to develop building-wide pest control strategies that deliver lasting results.

                  "German cockroaches are the most common species in NYC apartments and restaurants. They're light brown, about 1/2 inch long, and concentrate in kitchens and bathrooms near moisture and food sources. American cockroaches (\"water bugs\") are larger (1-2 inches), reddish-brown, and typically found in basements, boiler rooms, and sewer connections. Both species reproduce rapidly — a single German cockroach egg case contains 30-48 eggs with a 28-day incubation period. Professional cockroach extermination uses a combination of gel baits, dust formulations, IGR (insect growth regulator) treatments, and crack-and-crevice applications. Over-the-counter sprays and foggers are ineffective for established infestations and can actually spread cockroaches to new areas.",

They hide in mattress seams, box springs, headboards, bed frames, and baseboards during the day and emerge at night to feed. Signs of bed bug activity include small bloodstains on sheets, dark fecal spots on mattresses, shed skins, and itchy bite marks in linear patterns. In NYC, bed bugs spread through shared laundry facilities, used furniture, luggage, and building infrastructure. Professional bed bug treatment includes whole-room heat treatment (raising room temperature above 120°F for several hours), targeted chemical applications using residual insecticides, and follow-up inspections to confirm elimination.",

They burrow near foundations, dumpsters, and subway infrastructure. House mice are much smaller (3-4 inches), gray, and commonly found inside buildings at all levels. Both species contaminate food, damage property through gnawing (including electrical wiring, creating fire hazards), and carry disease. Signs include droppings, gnaw marks, grease rub marks along walls, and scratching sounds. Effective rodent control combines snap trapping, tamper-resistant bait stations, and — critically — exclusion work to seal entry points. Mice can squeeze through gaps as small as 1/4 inch, so thorough rodent-proofing is essential.",

                IPM is not just a buzzword — it&apos;s the foundation of effective, sustainable pest control. Our IPM approach starts with thorough inspection and pest identification, followed by an analysis of the conditions allowing the pest to thrive. We address root causes — sanitation issues, moisture problems, structural entry points, food source access — before applying targeted treatments. This approach delivers longer-lasting results with fewer chemical applications. IPM is required by law in NYC public housing, schools, and city buildings, and we apply these same principles to all residential and commercial pest control work. By combining prevention, monitoring, and targeted treatment, our exterminators achieve pest elimination that lasts — not just temporary knockdown that requires repeated applications.

              <p>
                Many NYC residents first attempt DIY pest control before calling a professional exterminator — and for minor, isolated pest sightings, basic prevention measures can be helpful. Sealing food containers, fixing leaky faucets, taking out trash regularly, and filling small gaps with caulk are all good practices that reduce pest pressure. Over-the-counter bait stations can handle a small ant trail or a single mouse sighting.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, established infestations in NYC almost always require professional pest control treatment. Here&apos;s why: over-the-counter sprays and foggers are repellent products — they push pests away from the sprayed area but don&apos;t eliminate the colony or nest. In multi-unit NYC buildings, this often means cockroaches and ants simply relocate to neighboring apartments or deeper into wall voids. Foggers (&quot;bug bombs&quot;) are particularly problematic — they contaminate surfaces, trigger fire alarms in apartment buildings, and distribute cockroaches to new areas of the home rather than eliminating them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Professional exterminators use non-repellent products — like gel baits and transfer-effect treatments — that pests carry back to their colony, creating a cascading kill effect that eliminates the entire population. Licensed pest control technicians also have access to professional-grade products not available in retail stores, and more importantly, they have the training and experience to identify pest species accurately, locate nesting sites and entry points, and apply treatments with precision to the exact areas where pests harbor.

                You should call a licensed exterminator immediately if you notice any of these signs in your NYC property:

              <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-sm text-zinc-400">
                <li><strong className="text-zinc-300">Multiple cockroach sightings during daytime</strong> — cockroaches are nocturnal, so daytime activity indicates a large population that&apos;s been pushed out of hiding areas due to overcrowding</li>
