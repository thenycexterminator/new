Our previous exterminator would spray and leave, but the roaches always came back within a week or two. The NYC Exterminator was completely different. Their pest control technician did a thorough inspection of our entire apartment, checked behind the refrigerator, under the sink, every crack and crevice in the baseboards. He explained that our building had a systemic issue and recommended a gel bait treatment combined with IGR applications. Within two weeks, we saw a dramatic reduction. By the fourth week, the cockroaches were completely gone. They even coordinated with our building management to treat adjacent units. This is real professional pest control, not just someone spraying chemicals and hoping for the best. Highly recommend this exterminator to anyone in Washington Heights dealing with roaches.",

We were waking up covered in bites and could see the little blood spots on our sheets. I called The NYC Exterminator on a Friday afternoon and they had a licensed pest control technician at our door by Saturday morning. The exterminator was incredibly thorough with the inspection, using a flashlight and magnifying tool to check every seam of our mattress, behind our headboard, and even the baseboards along the bedroom wall. They recommended a two-treatment approach with a follow-up inspection two weeks later. The first treatment knocked out the majority of the infestation, and the follow-up caught any remaining bugs that had hatched. We have been bed-bug-free for three months now. The exterminator also gave us practical advice about prevention, like using encasements on our mattress and being careful with secondhand furniture. If you are dealing with bed bugs anywhere in Brooklyn, do not waste your time with DIY solutions. Call a real exterminator.",

Then we found droppings in the basement and gnaw marks on some cardboard boxes. It was rats. I had tried snap traps and even those ultrasonic repellers you see online, but nothing worked. The NYC Exterminator sent out a pest control specialist who did a complete exterior inspection of our property. He found three entry points where rats were getting in: a gap around a dryer vent, a crack in the foundation near the basement window well, and a hole where an old cable line used to enter the house. They sealed everything up with steel wool and metal flashing, set up tamper-resistant bait stations around the perimeter, and placed snap traps in the basement. Within a week, the scratching stopped. They came back for two follow-up visits to check the stations and confirm the exclusion work was holding up. This is what professional pest control looks like. Best exterminator we have ever used in Queens, hands down.",

Every November like clockwork, we would start finding droppings in the kitchen cabinets and hear mice running through the walls. We had tried everything: poison bait from the hardware store, glue traps, peppermint oil, even stuffing steel wool into every gap we could find. Nothing gave us lasting relief. The NYC Exterminator approached the problem completely differently from any other pest control company we had used. Their exterminator spent over an hour inspecting the entire brownstone from basement to attic. He identified over a dozen potential entry points that we had never noticed, including gaps around old radiator pipes, a deteriorating door sweep on the basement entry, and openings where the plumbing stack went through the floors. They performed a comprehensive exclusion, sealing every gap with appropriate materials. Then they set up interior monitoring stations and an exterior bait program. For the first time in seven years, we made it through the entire winter without a single mouse sighting. This pest control service paid for itself many times over. Absolutely worth every penny for anyone in Park Slope or the surrounding Brooklyn neighborhoods.",

They come on a monthly schedule and always work around our operating hours, arriving early in the morning before we open. We passed our last two DOH inspections with zero pest-related violations.

We had owned the house for fifteen years and never had any idea there was an issue. The inspector found mud tubes along the foundation wall in the basement and damage to a floor joist. I called several pest control companies for quotes, and The NYC Exterminator was the most thorough by far. Their termite exterminator did a complete inspection that took well over an hour. He crawled through the entire accessible crawlspace, checked every exposed piece of wood in the basement, inspected the exterior foundation, and even looked at the tree stumps in our yard. He found active termite activity in two areas and explained exactly what type of treatment would be most effective for our situation. They installed a liquid barrier treatment around the foundation perimeter and set up monitoring stations in the yard. The entire process was explained clearly at every step, with no high-pressure sales tactics. They also provided the termite clearance letter we needed for our refinance. Six months later, the monitoring stations show zero activity. Outstanding pest control work. If you live in the Bronx and suspect termites, do not wait.

The building management recommended The NYC Exterminator, and I am so grateful they did. The pest control technician arrived the next morning and was incredibly professional and discreet, which mattered a lot to me in a co-op where everyone knows everyone. He confirmed the infestation was limited to the master bedroom and recommended a targeted treatment plan rather than trying to upsell me on whole-apartment fumigation. The first treatment was thorough and methodical. He treated every crack and seam in the bed frame, the baseboards, behind outlet covers, and the closet adjacent to the bedroom. Two weeks later they returned for the follow-up treatment. I have had zero bites since the first treatment, and the follow-up inspection confirmed complete elimination. The exterminator also educated me on how to inspect hotel rooms when traveling to prevent bringing bed bugs home again.

I finally convinced the landlord to hire The NYC Exterminator for a building-wide treatment. Their pest control team treated every unit in the building on the same day, which the exterminator explained is critical for eliminating cockroaches in multi-unit buildings because they just migrate from treated units to untreated ones. The difference was immediate and dramatic. Within a week, roach sightings dropped by at least ninety percent across the building. After the follow-up treatment two weeks later, we were essentially cockroach-free for the first time in years. Several of my neighbors have told me this was the best pest control decision the building ever made. If you live in a multi-unit building in Jackson Heights or anywhere in Queens and are dealing with cockroaches, the key is getting the whole building treated at once, and The NYC Exterminator is the company to make that happen.",

Mice were using these gaps as highways into our unit.

Multiple studs and the sill plate along one side of the house had significant termite damage. After getting three quotes, we went with The NYC Exterminator because their pest control approach was the most comprehensive. Their exterminator did not just want to treat the active termites. He developed a full protection plan that included liquid treatment of the affected area, installation of a bait monitoring system around the entire perimeter of the house, and quarterly inspections for the first year. He also identified conducive conditions that were attracting termites, like wood mulch piled against the foundation and a leaking gutter that was keeping the soil saturated near the damaged wall. We addressed those issues on his recommendation, and twelve months later, our annual inspection showed zero termite activity anywhere on the property. The exterminator saved us from what could have been tens of thousands of dollars in additional structural damage.

I had already tried two different pest control companies before calling The NYC Exterminator, and neither one had been able to fully eliminate the problem. The difference with this company was apparent from the very first visit. Their exterminator did not just treat the bedroom where I was getting bitten. He inspected every room in the apartment and found evidence that bed bugs had spread to the living room couch and a guest bedroom that nobody was even sleeping in. He explained that this is actually very common and that other pest control companies often fail because they only treat the obvious areas. The treatment was comprehensive and included chemical application to all infested areas, dust treatment in wall voids and behind electrical outlets, and mattress encasements for every bed in the apartment. Two weeks later, the follow-up treatment caught a few remaining nymphs that had hatched since the first treatment. After the final inspection, I was declared bed-bug-free, and it has been two months with zero bites. This exterminator team truly knows bed bugs inside and out.

    text: "We manage a small apartment building in Inwood, sixteen units total, and maintaining effective pest control across all units has always been a challenge. We brought on The NYC Exterminator as our building-wide pest control provider about a year ago, and the improvement has been dramatic. Their exterminator team conducts monthly visits that include inspection and treatment of common areas, basement, compactor room, and any units where tenants have reported issues. They maintain a detailed log of activity and treatment for every visit, which has been incredibly useful for tracking trends and demonstrating compliance during HPD inspections. Before switching to this company, we were getting multiple pest complaints every month from tenants. In the last six months, complaints have dropped to nearly zero. The tenants are happy, the building is cleaner, and our HPD violation record is spotless. For any property manager in Manhattan or any NYC borough looking for reliable, thorough building-wide pest control, The NYC Exterminator is the answer. Their exterminator team is professional, responsive, and delivers real results.",

    text: "I noticed what I thought were flying ants coming out of a crack in my basement wall in our Howard Beach home. Turned out they were termite swarmers, which is apparently a sign of a mature colony. The NYC Exterminator came out the same day I called and confirmed active subterranean termites. Their exterminator explained that our area of Howard Beach, being close to the water table, has higher-than-average termite pressure. The treatment plan included trenching and treating the soil along the foundation with a liquid termiticide, direct treatment of the affected wall area, and installation of a bait monitoring system around the perimeter. He was also honest about the structural damage he observed and recommended we have a contractor evaluate the affected floor joist. The pest control treatment was done in a single day, and the monitoring bait stations were installed the following week. Three months later, monitoring shows zero termite activity. The bait stations will continue to be checked quarterly. Excellent, honest, thorough exterminator work. Any homeowner in Queens should have a termite inspection done regularly, and if you need treatment, this is the pest control company to trust.",

I first noticed bites on my ankles and thought it was mosquitoes until I found a live bed bug on my pillowcase. I called The NYC Exterminator in a panic, and they calmed me down and scheduled an inspection for the very next day. The pest control technician was reassuring and professional. He found moderate bed bug activity in the bedroom and a few in the living room near the couch. He laid out a clear treatment plan and timeline so I knew exactly what to expect. The preparation instructions were detailed but manageable. The first treatment was thorough, covering every room in the apartment as a precaution. Two weeks later, the follow-up treatment and inspection confirmed the infestation was under control. A final inspection two weeks after that gave us the all-clear. The entire experience, while stressful, was handled with a level of professionalism and care that made a difficult situation much more bearable. This exterminator team genuinely cares about their customers and it shows in the quality of their pest control work. Chelsea residents, bookmark this company's number.",

It was affecting our ability to store inventory properly and was a constant concern for health code compliance. The NYC Exterminator provided exactly the kind of commercial pest control we needed. Their exterminator identified the sewer system as the source and installed drain screens as a first line of defense. He then treated the storage area with a combination of residual spray along the baseboards and gel bait in crack and crevice areas. A growth regulator treatment was applied to prevent any remaining roaches from reproducing. Monthly maintenance visits keep the problem under control, and we have not seen a single American cockroach in the storage area since the third week after initial treatment. For any business owner in Sunset Park or South Brooklyn dealing with pest issues, this exterminator company understands the specific challenges of commercial pest control and delivers consistent results.",

The NYC Exterminator was discreet and professional, which I appreciated. Their pest control technician identified entry points around the old radiator pipes and kitchen plumbing. He sealed everything, set up monitoring stations, and the mice were gone within a week. I am giving four stars instead of five only because the initial appointment had to be pushed back by a day due to their schedule being full, which was a minor inconvenience. The actual exterminator work itself was flawless. Clean, efficient, no mess, and the technician wore shoe covers and treated our apartment with the kind of care you would expect in a white-glove building. This pest control company understands how to work in high-end Manhattan properties. Would recommend to neighbors and fellow Upper East Side residents without hesitation.",

We are talking decades of infestations that no pest control company had been able to solve long-term. When the building was bought by a new management company, they hired The NYC Exterminator for a comprehensive building-wide treatment program. The exterminator team treated every single unit and all common areas on the same day, which apparently is the key to success in multi-unit buildings. The difference was like night and day. Within two weeks, I went from seeing multiple roaches daily to seeing none. The monthly maintenance visits have kept it that way for three months now. This is the first time in my fifteen years of living in this building that we have been truly cockroach-free. The pest control technicians are always professional, arrive on time, and treat residents with respect. If your building management is looking for a reliable exterminator for building-wide cockroach control in the Bronx, The NYC Exterminator should be at the top of the list.",

The NYC Exterminator set us up with a proactive IPM program from day one. Their exterminator inspected the entire space before we even opened, identified potential vulnerabilities like gaps around the hood vent exhaust and the rear door threshold, and recommended corrections we made during our buildout. We have been open for six months now with monthly pest control service, and we have never had a single pest issue. Not one cockroach, not one mouse, nothing. The preventive approach saves money compared to dealing with an active infestation, and more importantly, it protects our brand and our customers. For any restaurant or food service business opening in Brooklyn, investing in proactive pest control with a quality exterminator from the start is one of the smartest things you can do.

She had been too embarrassed to say anything for weeks, and by the time I found out, the bed bug infestation had spread to multiple pieces of furniture. I called The NYC Exterminator first thing the next morning and they had a pest control technician at her apartment by early afternoon. The exterminator was patient and compassionate with my mother, explaining everything in simple terms and not making her feel ashamed. He inspected every room and found bed bugs in the bedroom and the living room recliner where she sometimes naps. The treatment plan included two full treatments spaced two weeks apart, plus encasements for the mattress and box spring. He also helped us identify that the infestation likely originated from a secondhand armchair she had received from a neighbor. Both treatments went smoothly, and by the final inspection, there was zero bed bug activity. My mother is sleeping peacefully again, and I cannot express how grateful our family is for the compassion and professionalism of this exterminator team.

The NYC Exterminator dispatched a pest control technician who specialized in rodent control. He mapped out the entire burrow system in our yard, which was far more extensive than we realized, with tunnels running along the fence line and under our concrete patio. The treatment included direct burrow treatment with dry ice to collapse the tunnels, followed by installation of tamper-resistant bait stations at strategic points around the perimeter. He also identified that our compost bin was acting as a food source and recommended relocating it and switching to a fully enclosed design. Within two weeks, all burrow activity had ceased. The follow-up visit confirmed zero rat activity. Our yard is finally safe for our family again. This exterminator clearly knows rodent behavior and how to address the root causes of rat infestations, not just the symptoms. Best pest control experience we have ever had in the Bronx.",

                At {SITE_NAME}, customer satisfaction is not just a marketing
                slogan. It is the foundation of every pest control treatment we
                perform and every interaction our exterminators have with the
                people of New York City. When you read our reviews, you will
                notice a pattern: customers consistently praise the thoroughness
                of our inspections, the knowledge of our pest control
                technicians, the effectiveness of our treatments, and the
                professionalism of our entire exterminator team. These are not
                accidents. They are the result of a deliberate commitment to
                excellence in every aspect of our pest control operations.
              </p>

              <p>
                Every exterminator on our team holds a valid NYS DEC Commercial
                Pesticide Applicator license, which requires passing rigorous
                examinations and completing ongoing continuing education. But
                licensing is just the starting point. Our pest control
                technicians undergo extensive internal training on the latest
                treatment methods, customer communication, property protection
                protocols, and the specific pest challenges that are unique to
                New York City properties. Whether they are treating a pre-war

              <p>
                We believe that effective pest control begins with a thorough
                inspection. That is why every one of our{" "}

                </Link>{" "}
                starts with a comprehensive assessment of your property. Our
                exterminators do not just look at the area where you are seeing
                pests. They inspect the entire property to understand the full
                scope of the issue, identify entry points and conducive
                conditions, and develop a treatment plan that addresses root
                causes rather than just symptoms. This approach is why our
                customers consistently report long-lasting results from our pest
                control treatments, rather than the temporary relief they
                experienced with other exterminator services.
              </p>

              <p>
                Transparency is another core value that runs through every
                customer review. Our exterminators provide free inspections,
                written quotes before any work begins, and clear explanations of
                what treatment is being recommended and why. There are no hidden
                fees, no surprise charges, and no high-pressure upselling. If a
                simple treatment will solve your pest problem, that is what we
                will recommend. If a more comprehensive approach is needed, we
                will explain exactly why and give you all the information you
                need to make an informed decision. This honest, straightforward
                approach to pest control is reflected in the trust our customers
                express in their reviews.

                Communication is something our reviewers highlight again and
                again. From the moment you call our office to the completion of
                your final follow-up visit, our team keeps you informed at every
                step. Our exterminators explain what they find during the
                inspection, what treatment they recommend, how to prepare for the
                treatment, what to expect during and after application, and what
                follow-up will be needed. We also provide written reports after
                every service visit, which are especially valuable for property
                managers and commercial clients who need documentation for
                compliance purposes. This level of communication is a hallmark of
                professional pest control, and it is something we take seriously
                with every single customer.
              </p>

              <p>
                We are also deeply committed to using safe, EPA-approved products
                and methods. Our pest control treatments use targeted
                applications that minimize exposure to non-target organisms,
                including your family, pets, and the environment. Our
                exterminators are trained in Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
                principles, which prioritize non-chemical solutions like
                exclusion and sanitation recommendations alongside targeted
                chemical treatments. This balanced, science-based approach to
                pest control delivers better long-term results while keeping
                safety as a top priority.

              Our pest control process also includes something many
              exterminator companies overlook: education. As you can see in
              the reviews above, our customers frequently mention that our
              exterminators took time to explain the biology of the pest they
              were dealing with, the reasons behind the treatment approach, and
              the steps the customer could take to prevent future infestations.
              We believe that an educated customer is a satisfied customer, and
              that prevention-focused pest control is always more effective and
              more affordable than reactive treatment.

              Choosing a NYC Exterminator

              <p>
                Choosing a pest control company in New York City is not a
                decision to take lightly. With hundreds of exterminators
                operating across the five boroughs, the quality of service
                varies dramatically. Some pest control operators are unlicensed,
                use improper products, or provide ineffective treatments that
                waste your money and leave your pest problem unresolved. That is
                why reading verified customer reviews is one of the most
                important steps you can take before hiring an exterminator.
              </p>

              <p>
                Reviews from real customers give you insight into every aspect
                of a pest control company&apos;s service: their response time,
                the thoroughness of their inspections, the effectiveness of
                their treatments, their communication, their pricing
                transparency, and whether the results last. When you read the
                reviews on this page, you will see consistent themes that
                reflect our core values as an exterminator company: honesty,
                thoroughness, expertise, and results that last.
              </p>

              <p>
                We encourage every potential customer to compare our reviews
                with those of other pest control companies. Look for
                specificity and detail, since genuine reviews describe specific
                situations, neighborhoods, building types, and outcomes. Look
                for consistency, because a high average rating across thousands
                of reviews is more meaningful than a perfect score across a
                handful. And look for how the company handles the occasional
                less-than-perfect review, since our response to constructive
                feedback is always professional, accountable, and focused on
                making things right.
