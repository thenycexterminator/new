  {
    q: "What does the $249/hour rate actually include?",
    a: "Everything. Labor, EPA-registered products, all treatment methods, equipment, sealing materials for entry points, written treatment plan, and the free re-treatment visit if pests return. There are no per-room fees, no product upcharges, no trip fees, no inspection fees, no contract minimums. The hour you pay for is the only hour you pay for.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is hourly better than a flat-rate quote?",
    a: "Flat-rate quotes are priced for the worst-case version of your problem the exterminator has never seen. If your job is actually simpler, you still pay the inflated number. Hourly bills you for what your specific problem actually takes — a small ant trail might be 30 minutes ($125), a serious roach job might be 90 minutes ($375). You pay for time, not for the company's guess at a worst case. We're the only fully inclusive hourly exterminator pricing platform in NYC built around this.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I pay anything upfront?",
    a: "No. You pay nothing upfront and nothing during the inspection. We bill on completion — after the technician has finished the job and you can see the work was done. If you're not satisfied, you don't pay. No deposits, no holds, no card-on-file required to book.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any contracts or recurring charges?",
    a: "No contracts. No recurring charges. No monthly minimums. No auto-renewals. You book a single visit, we solve the problem, you pay for that hour (or fraction of an hour), and we're done. If pests come back inside the guarantee window, we return at no charge. If you want a follow-up later, you book another single visit at the same $249/hour rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the catches?",
    a: "There are no catches. We were tired of NYC pest control being a 'call for a quote' black box where the price is whatever the company thinks you'll pay. $249/hour, billed in 15-minute increments after the first hour, fully inclusive, pay on completion. That's the entire pricing model. No hidden fees, no chemical surcharges, no weekend rates, no upsells.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly will I hear back after scheduling?",
    a: "We respond to every booking request within 10 to 30 minutes during business hours (Monday-Friday 7 AM-8 PM, Saturday 8 AM-6 PM, Sunday 9 AM-5 PM). If you submit your request after hours, you'll hear from a licensed pest control technician first thing the next morning. For emergencies, call or text 212-202-8545 for the fastest response.",
  },
  {
    q: "How soon can a technician come to my property?",
    a: "Usually next business day. Same-day service is available for active emergencies — bed bug discoveries, rat sightings, wasps near doorways. We serve all five NYC boroughs, northern New Jersey, Long Island, and Westchester County. Every appointment has a tight 1-hour arrival window — no 'between 8 AM and 5 PM' nonsense.",
  },
  {
    q: "What pest services can I book at the $249/hr rate?",
    a: "Every service we offer is billed at the same $249/hour rate — cockroaches, bed bugs, rats, mice, ants, termites, wasps, fleas, wildlife removal, commercial accounts, all of it. The pest type doesn't change the price. The only thing that affects what you pay is how long the job actually takes.",
